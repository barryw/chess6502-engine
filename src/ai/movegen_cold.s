; Generated ca65 port from Chess/ai/movegen_cold.asm.
; Keep source changes in this repository in ca65 syntax.

; import-once was handled by the ca65 include topology

; Cold move-generation helpers. Keep rare promotion handling after the hot
; search modules so ordinary move ordering/search layout stays stable.

;
; AddPawnPromotionMoves - Add queen and knight promotion moves
; Uses $f7 = from square, $fa = to square
; Quiet promotions are inserted before already-generated quiet moves so search
; considers the queening move early. Promotion captures keep generator order;
; MVV-LVA already treats them as tactical captures.
; Clobbers: A, X
